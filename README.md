projecteuler 
===========

My attempts to solve Project Euler problems, in whatever language I
please. I try to make my solutions elegant as possible, which means
starting off by using elegant languages like Haskell and Scheme.

Jun 13 2014: I'm rewriting the Python solutions. Too imperative. Too
disgusting.
